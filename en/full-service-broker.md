A brokerage firm that executes buy and sell orders, researches investment targets, assists in setting and achieving investment goals, and provides investment advice. In exchange for these services, they charge commissions. When the market is bullish and stock prices are on the rise, there are plenty of good deals to be had, but when the market is in trouble, solid advice can come to your rescue. Some brokerage firms sell various types of mutual funds that perform well, offer estate planning services (inheritance, gift, and trust measures), and provide tax advice. Based on your assets, income, goals, and objectives, they will create a financial profile of you and give you qualified advice. Needless to say, it costs more than a discount broker who does nothing as long as they do all this and more for you.
