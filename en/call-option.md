The right to buy a certain commodity at a predetermined specific price (i.e., strike price) by a certain date in the future, regardless of the market price at that time. In call option trading, there are buyers (buying the right to buy: Long Call) and sellers (selling the right to buy: Short Call) at the same time. When a new trade is initiated, the buyer pays the premium (option price), while the seller receives the premium. When the buyer exercises the option at the time of settlement, he or she can obtain the underlying instrument at the strike price. On the other hand, the seller must accept the exercise.
