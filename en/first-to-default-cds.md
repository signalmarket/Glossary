It is a type of CDS (basket CDS) that bears the credit risk of multiple reference entities, and if a credit event is recognized for any one of the reference entities, the CDS is terminated with a covenant that redemption will be made at the market price of the relevant entity's debt (even if the debt is delivered in physical form). The CDS is structured in such a way that it enjoys a higher spread than each of the reference organizations.
