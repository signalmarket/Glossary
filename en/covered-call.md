An investment strategy that uses options trading to take a sell position in a call option on the underlying asset while holding the underlying asset. It is also called a "covered call strategy. By selling the call option, you receive the option premium in exchange for giving up a certain level of appreciation in the underlying asset. Generally, this strategy is effective when the underlying asset is not expected to fluctuate much in the future (the underlying asset of the call option sold will remain at a level not exceeding the strike price).
