The World Bank is the collective name for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), two of the World Bank Group's five international institutions that provide loans and grants to governments of low- and middle-income countries to advance capital projects. Established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, along with the International Monetary Fund, IDA made its first loan to France in 1947; in the 1970s, it focused on lending to developing countries, but in the 1980s it moved away from lending to developing countries. During the past 30 years, the Fund has also included NGOs and environmental groups in its lending. Its lending strategy has been influenced by the Millennium Development Goals and environmental and social security schemes.
