A "credit rating" is information that is provided to investors by a third party who has no interest in the rated bond, etc., and whose result is indicated by a concise symbol, based on the judgment (evaluation) of the degree of certainty that the principal and interest will be paid as promised. The rating agency is the place where this judgment (evaluation) is made. Rating agencies evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively the stability of an issuer's financial base and earnings structure with respect to the certainty of debt repayment. Representative rating agencies include Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Rating and Investment Information, and Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. Based on the same concept, banks, including trust banks, have bank deposit solvency ratings, and life insurance companies have insurance financial strength ratings (insurance claims-paying ability ratings).
