A floorlet is the optional element of each interest payment that constitutes an interest rate floor. An interest rate floor is a transaction whereby the buyer of the floor (option) pays a premium (option fee) to the seller to receive the difference (interest rate differential) if the base rate falls below the floor rate (contracted minimum rate) on each interest rate renewal date during the contract period.
