A knock-in option is a type of barrier option where the option right is triggered when the price of the underlying asset reaches a certain price (knock-in price). Specifically, the option right is triggered when the underlying asset price (market level) reaches the knock-in price at least once during the option period. A barrier option is an option whose right is triggered or extinguished depending on whether or not the price of the underlying asset reaches a certain price (barrier). In general, the premium (option fee) for a knock-in option is lower than that for a regular option because a condition is attached to the occurrence of the option right. There are also "up-and-in" and "down-and-in" call options and put options in combination with barriers as their types.
