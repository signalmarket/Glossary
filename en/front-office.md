Front office is a business term used as a generic term for departments that have direct contact with clients. They are the front, or front line, of the office and interact with clients. The front of the front office is meant to contrast with the back office, which is out of the public eye. Because it is a position that communicates directly with clients, it requires the ability to be resourceful and understanding. In the case of a bank, the front office includes the reception desk, a call center that handles inquiries and questions directly from customers, and salespeople who sell services to customers.
