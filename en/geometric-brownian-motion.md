A geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process[1] whose logarithmic variation follows a Brownian motion with mean μ variance σ. It is often used in models related to financial markets and option pricing in financial engineering. It is often used in models related to financial markets and option pricing in financial engineering. The name "geometric" is derived from the fact that the increment of the geometric Brownian motion is expressed as a ratio to
