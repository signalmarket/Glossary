A currency swap is a transaction that exchanges interest rates between different currencies, usually involving an exchange of principal. When conducting transactions denominated in foreign currencies, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect cash flows and corporate earnings, such as a decrease in the amount of sales. Therefore, financial instruments such as derivatives may be used to avoid foreign exchange risks. Financial instruments include currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, and currency options. When actually using such instruments, it is important to verify the effectiveness of risk avoidance, such as fees and restrictions on transaction units.
