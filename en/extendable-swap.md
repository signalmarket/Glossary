An extendible swap is a swap in which one party to the transaction has the right to further extend the initial swap term. For example, in a case where the payer has the right to extend the swap, if the market interest rate is above the fixed rate of the swap at the end of the initial swap term, the payer can exercise its right to extend the extendable swap and enjoy the benefit of paying a lower fixed rate than the market interest rate after the swap extension. This is a benefit. On the other hand, in cases where the receiver has the right to extend the swap, if the market interest rate is below the fixed rate of the swap at the end of the initial swap term, the receiver can exercise its right to extend the extendable swap and enjoy the benefit of receiving a fixed rate of interest that is higher than the market interest rate after the swap extension. The receiver will enjoy the benefit of receiving a fixed rate of interest that is higher than the market rate after the extension of the swap.
