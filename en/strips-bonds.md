Developed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, it refers to an interest-bearing bond in which the principal and coupon portions are separated and each portion is sold as a zero-coupon discount bond. Interest-bearing bonds usually consist of a principal portion and a coupon portion, but strips are sold with the principal portion as a discount bond (zero-coupon bond) maturing on the redemption date of the interest-bearing bond and each coupon as a discount bond (zero-coupon bond) maturing on the coupon payment date of the bond. Treasury Note Basic and Treasury Bond Basic are the strips for the original headquarters, and investors in Japan can also purchase them.
