Duration matching means matching the duration of bonds and policy reserves within a certain range so that the market value of bonds and policy reserves fluctuate in line with changes in interest rates. This does not mean that the market value of bonds and policy reserves should be calculated and reduced by strictly managing assets and liabilities on a market value basis. Therefore, it should be noted that the definition of duration control is different from the definition of duration control in "2. Treatment of Macro Hedging" in the Industry Audit Report No. 16.
