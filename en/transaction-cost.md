Transaction cost is a term in the field of economics that refers to the costs incurred when participating in economic transactions in the market[1]. The fees charged by financial institutions when buying and selling financial instruments and transferring the proceeds to an account are examples of transaction costs, but the labor and effort required to determine which instruments to purchase, as well as price negotiations with counterparties, also constitute transaction costs.
