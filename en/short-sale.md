A short sale is a sale of shares borrowed from another party without holding or using stock certificates. Short sellers sell shares at the current price in anticipation of a decline in the share price in the near future, and then buy them back at a lower price to return the borrowed shares. The difference at that time is the profit. One of the advantages of short selling is the ability to make a profit even when the stock price declines. There are also two types of short selling: speculative short selling, which targets a decline in the stock price, and bridging short selling, which prevents the loss of shares owned due to a decline in the stock price. Securities finance companies procure shares from outside sources when it becomes difficult to procure shares to sell short. The fee for procuring the shares (loan charges) incurred at this time is called the reverse daily yield, and is borne by the seller.
