Options trading is the buying or selling of the right to purchase an option (option) at a certain price in the future. There are four forms: options to buy a call (call-on-call), options to sell a call (call-on-put), options to buy a put (put-on-call), and options to sell a put (put-on-put). It is characterized by two strike prices and two strike dates. In the case of a call-on-call, the holder has the right to buy the call option by paying the first strike price on the first strike date, and the purchased call option can be used to purchase the underlying asset by paying the second strike price on the second strike date.
