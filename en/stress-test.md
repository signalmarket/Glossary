Stress testing is a risk management technique that simulates in advance the extent of losses in a portfolio (position) and measures to avoid losses, in preparation for unforeseen events in the market (financial market). Looking at past history, financial markets sometimes experience significant price fluctuations that are unthinkable under normal market conditions, such as Black Monday, the Asian currency crisis, and the Lehman shock, once every 10 or 20 years. In this stress test, we prepare several risk scenarios that are generally considered to have a low probability of occurrence, and extract those with an abnormal environment from historical data. The purpose is to prepare for unforeseen events.
