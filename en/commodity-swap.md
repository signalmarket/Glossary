Similar to interest rate swaps, which exchange floating and fixed interest rates, swap transactions exchange fixed and floating prices for commodities such as crude oil and nonferrous metals. Also called "commodity swap." In principle, the transaction is a negotiated transaction. When a transportation company wants to fix the future fuel procurement price, it enters into a commodity swap transaction with a financial institution. Financial institutions use overseas futures markets to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.
