The issuance of securities backed by the cash flow of a specific asset holding and their circulation in the market. In English, it is called securitization. Securitized products are also called asset securitized products. A wide variety of assets are subject to securitization, including real estate, asset-backed securities, RMBS, and CMBS. In the case of real estate securitization, the rights to the income and other benefits generated from the real estate are converted into small units in the form of securities, and investors and financial institutions receive them as "dividends" or "principal and interest payments" through the market, leading to the diversification of risk. From the investor's perspective, this has the advantage of providing investment opportunities in high-yield financial instruments, but it also means that the investor must directly bear the risk of the investee.
