Hedge accounting may be applied when derivatives are used as a means to reduce losses arising from assets or liabilities held (hedging) and when certain requirements are met. When derivatives are used as hedging instruments, if the accounting treatment in principle is followed, the timing of recognition of gains or losses on the hedged asset (liability) and the timing of recognition of gains or losses on the hedging instrument (derivative, etc.) may be different, and the effect of the hedge may not be reflected in the financial statements. To prevent such a situation from occurring, hedge accounting is an accounting treatment in which gains and losses on the hedged asset (liability) and the hedging instrument are recognized in the same accounting period and the effect of the hedge is reflected in the financial statements. There are two types of hedge accounting: "deferred hedge" in which gains or losses on derivatives as hedging instruments are deferred until the time when gains or losses on the hedged asset (liability) are recognized (when the hedge ends), and "fair value hedge" in which gains or losses on the hedged asset (liability) are recognized at the same time as gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized. In addition, under certain conditions, hedge accounting may be applied to interest rate swaps, in which fixed-rate insurance liabilities (policy reserves) are grouped according to the maturity of future cash flows and the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations are hedged by receiving fixed interest and paying floating interest, as a special exception permitted for insurance companies. The application of hedge accounting is permitted (referred to as comprehensive hedging).
