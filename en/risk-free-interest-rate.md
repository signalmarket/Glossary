The risk-free interest rate, risk-free rate (RFR), risk-free interest rate[1], or safe interest rate[2] is the yield (interest rate) generated by a risk-free asset (theoretically, a risk-free item). In reality, there is no such thing as a risk-free asset, but a substitute for a risk-free asset would be short-term government bonds of developed countries (treasury bills in Japan).
