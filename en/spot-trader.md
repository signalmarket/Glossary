Interest rates that exist in the world are always classified as either "spot rates" or "forward rates". Spot rates are interest rates that apply between the present and a point in the future. For example, if we consider four points in time: the present, one year from now, two years from now, and three years from now, there are six possible interest rates that will apply between those four points in time. The interest rate that uses the current point in time as the starting point is called the spot rate.
