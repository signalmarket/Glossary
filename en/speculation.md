Speculation (toki) is the act of trying to profit from the prospect of short-term price fluctuations. Originally a Zen Buddhist term, it refers to a meeting of minds between two masters and disciples. In Zen, "ki" means "the action of the mind. The master and disciple mutually throw their own "ki" into the other's "ki. This became the "kiai" of communicating heart to heart. Since the "workings of the human mind" change in various ways, "speculation" became the act of catching the moment-by-moment movement and workings of the "ki" in a flash[1]. Later, speculation came to be used in the context of market fluctuations and changes in economic conditions, in situations where people read things deeply and sell or buy at the right time.
