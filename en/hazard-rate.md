Hazard ratio (HR) is, in survival analysis, the ratio of hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by the two levels of explanatory variables. For example, in a pharmaceutical study, the death rate per unit time in the treatment group may be twice the death rate in the control group. In this case, the hazard ratio would be 2, indicating a high hazard (risk) of death from the treatment. Hazard ratios differ from relative risks and odds ratios in that they represent the instantaneous risk over a study period or portion thereof, whereas relative risks and odds ratios are cumulative values across studies with defined endpoints (measures of disease occurrence). Hazard ratios are less susceptible to selection bias with respect to the selected endpoints and can indicate the risk (hazard) occurring before the endpoint.
