This is currently the predominant method for calculating Value at Risk. It calculates the distribution of profit/loss of assets held based on historical risk factor data (i.e., market price movements of stock prices, exchange rates, and interest rates). The value at risk is then calculated based on the value of losses that fall within the confidence level.
