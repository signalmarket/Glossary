One of the variance reduction methods in Monte Carlo. It is based on the fact that when a characteristic value of a system is estimated by Monte Carlo method, the variance will be smaller if other estimators with strong negative correlation are also used and the average of these estimators is used for estimation than if only one estimator is used for estimation.
