title: Notional amount

The Notional Amount is the principal amount used for interest rate calculations in derivative and swap transactions. Therefore, in actual transactions, the notional amount used in the calculation is generally not exchanged. For example, in an interest rate swap where a fixed rate of 5% is exchanged for a floating rate of TIBOR + 2%, only the interest portion is actually exchanged. However, in order to calculate the interest rate, a principal amount is required. Assuming the hypothetical principal is 1 million yen (notional principal), the interest rate exchanged would be only 50,000 yen and 1 million yen x (TIBOR+2%).
