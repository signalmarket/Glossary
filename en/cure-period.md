It is also called a cure period. For example, in the event of default by an off-taker (e.g., interruption of electricity supply), the default is not immediately deemed to be a default, but a certain period of time is contractually established during which the company does not pay for the service purchase, but the off-taker is allowed to cure the situation during that period. The period of time is called the cure period. This period is called the cure period.
