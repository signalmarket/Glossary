A method of placing an order by specifying a desired buy or sell price (upper limit price for buying and lower limit price for selling). For example, in stock trading, an order to "buy 1,000 shares of stock A at 500 yen" or "sell 1,000 shares of stock B at 500 yen" is called a limit order. A buy order can be executed if a sell order is placed at or below the specified price, and a sell order can be executed if a buy order is placed at or above the specified price. On the other hand, an order without specifying a price, such as "I want to buy at any price" or "I want to sell at any price," is called a "Naruyuki" order. There is also an order method called "stop order," which is the opposite of a normal limit order, such as "sell at 500 yen if the price falls to 500 yen" or "buy at 500 yen if the price rises to 500 yen.
