A transaction that focuses on the credit risk of corporate bonds and loan claims, quantifies this risk, and is conducted on individual terms and conditions among investors. Investors holding corporate bonds and other securities pay insurance to financial institutions that are judged to have low credit risk in order to avoid the risk of not being able to pay the principal of the bonds in the event of default. The amount of such insurance is determined on a case-by-case basis from time to time. As investors become more critical of a company's tax and financial soundness, the amount of insurance will move in the direction of an increase. In fact, in addition to the defaults mentioned above, other products have been devised to cover situations such as credit deterioration due to poor business performance. In terms of the form of transactions, a wide variety of products such as swaps, structured bonds, and options have been created through the use of derivatives.
