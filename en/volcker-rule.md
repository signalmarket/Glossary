The "bank market trading rules" are the core of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was enacted in the summer of 2010 and became fully effective on July 21, 2015. It prohibits banks from using their own funds (proprietary funds) to purchase, sell, acquire, or dispose of financial instruments at risk in order to improve the efficiency of their own assets under management. It was proposed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker at the urging of U.S. President Barack Obama. Specifically, it would restrict U.S. banks from trading derivatives and commodity futures, as well as from investing in private equity funds and hedge funds. On the other hand, hedging transactions for the purpose of risk aversion by customers, market making transactions, transactions in U.S. government bonds, government agency bonds, municipal bonds, and foreign government bonds at the U.S. offices of foreign banks are exempted from the regulations. The introduction of the new regulation was based on the principle of "never again allowing depositors' money to be used for high-risk transactions.
