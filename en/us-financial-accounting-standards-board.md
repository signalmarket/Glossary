The accounting standard-setter in the United States. Established in 1973 as an independent, private, not-for-profit organization, the FASB is recognized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies and its standards are recognized as authoritative by many other organizations, including state CPA Boards and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). After the FASB and the IASB agreed to converge IFRS and U.S. GAAP in 2002 (Norwalk Agreement), the FASB and the IASB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2006 to accelerate the integration and have been working together on the convergence. The FASB and the IASB have jointly issued common revenue recognition standards and other standards at their Boards. However, the FASB and the IASB have not necessarily reached agreement on all principles and individual issues.
