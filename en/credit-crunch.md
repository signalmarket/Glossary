A phenomenon in which lending by financial institutions shrinks. Also known as the "credit crunch. It refers to a situation in which banks and other financial institutions curtail their lending, resulting in a shortage of funds and a loss of liquidity in the market. The reluctance to lend against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the disposal of non-performing loans is believed to have a negative impact on the economy through higher interest rates and pressure on corporate management.
