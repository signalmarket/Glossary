Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO: Collateralized Debt Obligation) is a type of Asset Backed Securities (ABS), and is a security whose assets backing the issue are multiple corporate bonds or multiple loan claims. Among CDOs, those whose assets backing the issue are multiple corporate bonds are called Collateralized Bond Obligation (CBO), and those whose assets backing the issue are multiple corporate loan claims (loan claims) are called Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO). CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligation) are securities where the assets backing the issue are multiple corporate loan claims (loan claims). CLOs are issued by pooling several hundred corporate bonds or loan receivables and issuing securities backed by the portfolio, with principal and interest payments made from cash flows from the portfolio. The securities can be divided into two types: higher-rated securities, which are paid first by cash flows from the portfolio, and lower-rated securities, which are paid later, in order to meet the needs of investors with different preferences.
