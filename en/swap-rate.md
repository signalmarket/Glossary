When referring to the swap rate, it generally refers to the fixed rate level of a "plain vanilla swap" that exchanges LIBOR for a fixed rate of interest. This rate not only indicates the level of the interest rate swap, but also the level of the bank's fixed-rate funding rate, which is a very important and widely referenced rate in today's financial world. In general, the prices of financial derivatives are calculated based on the LIBOR and swap rate interest rate system, and this interest rate is indispensable in looking at current finance.
