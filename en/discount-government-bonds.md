Discount JGBs are JGBs issued with an amount equivalent to interest discounted in advance from their face value. No interest payments are made during the redemption period, but the face value is received at the time of redemption, so the difference between the issue price and the face value (redemption margin) is equivalent to interest. In Japan, medium-term government bonds with maturities of about 3 or 5 years, discount bills with maturities of 6 months or 1 year, and FBs with maturities of 60 days were issued, but since February 2009, they have become Treasury Discount Bills with maturities of 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, and their holdings are limited to corporations only.
