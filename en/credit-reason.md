A credit event, also called a "credit event," is an action or problem that may hinder the performance of the subject obligation (reference obligation), such as payment default, change of terms, or bankruptcy. The term is mainly used in credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS). Reference obligations include bonds and loans to national and local governments and general corporate customers, as well as securitized products.
