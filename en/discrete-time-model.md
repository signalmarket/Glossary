A "discrete-time model" refers to a method of calculating the value of stock options, such as a stock option pricing model, in which future stock price fluctuations are assumed to occur with a certain probability at regular intervals. A typical example of a discrete-time model is the binomial model, which assumes only two cases: an increase or a decrease in the stock price after one period based on a certain probability.
