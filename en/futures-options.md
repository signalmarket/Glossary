Futures and options are both financial instruments called derivatives. Futures and options are traded by predicting the price movements of the Nikkei Stock Average Index or JPX Nikkei Index 400, with which you are very familiar. In futures trading, you can start by "buying" if you expect the index to rise and "selling" if you expect it to fall.
