A copula is an Archimedian copula if it can be expressed as follows using a certain function φ. C(u, v) = φ-1(φ(u) + φ(v)) The function φ is a continuously monotonically decreasing function from [0, 1] to [ 0 , ∞ ] {\displaystyle [0,\infty ] } that satisfies φ(1) = 0. This φ is called a generator. W and Π above are also Archimedes copulas (generators are 1 - t and - ln t, respectively). Note that M is not an Archimedes copula.
