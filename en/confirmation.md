By "confirm," we mean, for example, a move that diverges significantly from a trend line and rises, then declines as if to confirm support at that trend line, firmly confirming its support level. Corrections tend to be particularly difficult to grasp when the price diverges significantly from a moving average or trend line, and it is difficult to determine at what point this confirme move will occur.
