It is a method of buying and selling various financial instruments around the world, including foreign exchange, commodities, stocks, and bonds, from a macro-observational perspective of global financial market trends, and is mainly used by large hedge funds. One of the best known examples is George Soros's large-scale selling of the British pound in 1992. At the time, the British currency system was based on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which controls exchange rate fluctuations within the European region, and Mr. Soros judged from a macro perspective that the British pound was being overvalued by the high-interest German currency. He sold the British pound until the British central bank could no longer continue its support of the British pound. As a result, the UK was forced to withdraw from the ERM and move to a floating exchange rate system.
