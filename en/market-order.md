A market order is an order placed without specifying a price when buying or selling. The price at which a trade is executed is determined by the counterparty to the executed trade. The person who places a market order trades with the most advantageous counterparty. In other words, when a market sell order is placed, the trade is executed with the highest bidder, and when a market buy order is placed, the trade is executed with the lowest offerder. In contrast to a market order, a limit order is an order that specifies a price at the time of purchase or sale.
