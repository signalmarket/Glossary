A knockout option is a type of barrier option in which the option right is extinguished when the underlying asset price reaches a certain price (knockout price). Specifically, if the underlying asset price (market level) does not reach the knockout price before maturity, the option right remains valid, but if the knockout price is reached, the option right is extinguished. Also, a barrier option is an option whose right is created or extinguished depending on whether or not the underlying asset price reaches a certain price (barrier). In general, a knockout option has a knockout condition attached to the buyer's right of the option, and the premium (option fee) is lower due to the disadvantageous condition to the buyer. There are also "up-and-out" and "down-and-out" call options and put options in combination with barriers as their types.
