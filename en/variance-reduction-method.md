Variance reduction in mathematics, especially in Monte Carlo theory, is a method used to improve the accuracy of estimation and can be applied depending on the given simulation and computational effort [1 1]. The random variable that is the output value of a simulation is associated with variance, a quantity that determines the accuracy of the results. In order to make the simulation statistically effective, i.e., the output of the random variable of interest has a higher precision and narrower confidence interval, variance reduction methods may be used. Typical examples are the common random number method, the symmetric variate method, the control variate method, the weighted sampling method, and the stratified sampling method. Subspace simulation and line sampling methods are sometimes used for simulations with black box models. Various specialized techniques exist in the subcategories of these items. For example, the "weight windows" and "splitting/Russian roulette" techniques are used extensively in particle transport simulations, and are a form of focused sampling.
