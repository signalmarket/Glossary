A revised version of the Basel I standards for capital adequacy and liquidity ratios of internationally active banks. Basel I was revised in 2004 with three main objectives: (1) to regulate minimum capital adequacy requirements (more precise risk measurement), (2) to allow banks themselves to consider the amount of capital required for their operations and for the authorities to verify the adequacy of such requirements, and (3) to improve the effectiveness of market discipline through enhanced information disclosure. Basel II, although the minimum level to be achieved (8% or more) remains the same as Basel I, the measurement of risk (denominator for calculating capital adequacy ratio) by banks has been made more precise. In Japan, the transition to Basel II began at the end of fiscal 2006 (and at the end of fiscal 2007 for some banks that use advanced risk measurement methods).
