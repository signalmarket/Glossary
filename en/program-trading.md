A system in which buy and sell orders are automatically placed according to predetermined rules and conditions (mainly via computer). The largest stock market crash in history (Black Monday) that occurred on October 19, 1987 in New York is said to have been triggered by this massive amount of programmed trading. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has been the first exchange in the world to conduct programmed trading of stocks. The Tokyo Stock Exchange defines trading of 25 or more stocks at a time as program trading and imposes reporting requirements.
