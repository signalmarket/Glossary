Weather derivatives are used to hedge (mitigate) losses incurred by customers due to abnormal or unfavorable weather conditions (i.e., reduced revenues resulting from reduced sales or increased expenses). The transaction is to receive money according to the difference between the value of the "index" (indemnity value) and the value of the "index generated by actual weather phenomena.
