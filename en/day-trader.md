A day trader is an investor who repeatedly closes a trade, making a profit or loss in a single day, such as selling a stock he bought that day or buying back a stock he sold that day. Investors who invest for very short periods of time are sometimes referred to as such. Some investors try to make steady profits by repeatedly buying and selling stocks in a short period of time within a single day. In recent years, the number of day traders has increased rapidly due to the spread of the Internet and competition among brokerage firms to lower their commissions.
