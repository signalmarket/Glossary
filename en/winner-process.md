A Wiener process in mathematics is a continuous-time stochastic process named after Norbert Wiener. The Wiener process is considered to be a mathematical model of Brownian motion and is often referred to as a Brownian process itself. It is one of the best-known LÃ©vy processes (right-continuous, stationary, independent, incrementally stochastic processes) and often appears in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, economics, and physics.
