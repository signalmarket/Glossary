The interest rate (annual percentage rate) used to calculate the "present value of a financial instrument or money" in the future. Also called discount rate. Generally, the discount rate for a financial instrument consists of the risk-free interest rate (the yield when no risk is taken) and the risk premium (the additional return that is expected when risk is taken). Conversely, the interest rate used to determine "how much the present value will be worth in the future" is called the "expected rate of return. The discount rate is also used to calculate the amount of money that a company should provide for retirement benefits and pensions (retirement benefit obligation), and the interest rate is determined based on the yield of safe bonds such as government bonds, government agency bonds, and high-quality corporate bonds.
