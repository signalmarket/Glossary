Time value is the value of an option that trades the right to buy or sell a stock or bond at a predetermined price by a specific date, and measures the expected future profit compared to if the right were exercised today. It is determined by the time to maturity and the magnitude of volatility, etc. The longer the remaining term and the greater the volatility, the greater the time value. The value decreases over time and the time value becomes zero at maturity. Therefore, the premium paid to buy the rights is calculated as the sum of the intrinsic value.
