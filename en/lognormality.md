In probability theory and statistics, the log-normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution. When taking the logarithm of a random variable following this distribution, the corresponding distribution is defined as following a normal distribution. Therefore, the multiplicative analogy of the central limit theorem holds, and the product of random variables following independent identical distributions asymptotically follows a log-normal distribution.
