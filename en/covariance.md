One of the risk indicators when investing in two or more assets. It measures how one asset (X) moves in relation to another asset (Y) and determines the correlation between the price movements of the two. Covariance = Average of ( Deviation of X x Deviation of Y ) * Deviation: Individual values of X and Y data minus the average * A positive covariance value tends to indicate price movements in the same direction (positive correlation), while a negative covariance value indicates price movements in the opposite direction (negative correlation). A value of zero indicates that there is no relationship between price movements. However, since the magnitude of the covariance value varies depending on the type of data and how the units are taken, the "correlation coefficient," which is the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y, is generally used to express the strength of the correlation.
