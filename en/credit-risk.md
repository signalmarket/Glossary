Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security (e.g., a country or company) will default on its obligations (i.e., be unable to pay interest or principal under predetermined terms) due to financial difficulties, poor management, or other reasons. If such a situation occurs or is expected to occur, the price of the issuer's securities will fall. In the worst case scenario, the issuer may go bankrupt and not be able to redeem the principal amount invested. In other words, the less creditworthy the issuer, the higher the credit risk.
