A bond that does not pay any interest until redemption. There is no coupon on the bond, and the bond is already discounted at a certain yield when it is issued, and the face value is paid at redemption. For example, a one-year discount bond with a face value of 100 yen issued at 98 yen yields approximately 2.04%.
