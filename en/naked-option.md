Selling an option without owning the underlying asset (e.g., cash stock). Since a premium (compensation) is received when selling an option, if the underlying asset moves as predicted by the seller and the option is not exercised, a profit will be made. However, if the underlying asset moves against the seller's prediction, the seller is obligated to exercise the option, and this is a high-risk transaction.
