The zero coupon rate, also known as the "spot rate" or "zero rate," is the rate on a zero-coupon bond (discount bond) with no interest payments along the way. Specifically, it refers to the "compound yield of a discount bond or equivalent interest rate" that matures in a certain period of time after the current date. In general, the zero coupon rate is used to discount future cash flows to present value because there are no interest payments and no redeployment issues, and it is the basis for calculating the present value (theoretical value) of a financial instrument. In general, government bonds with no default risk are used in the calculation.
