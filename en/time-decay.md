Time decay, in Japanese, is the decrease in time value. In options trading of financial assets, this refers to the fact that the "time value" of an option decreases with the passage of time. The value of an option is calculated as the sum of the "intrinsic value" and the "time value." The "time value" decreases slowly at first, accelerates as the number of days remaining until maturity approaches, and finally reaches zero, as the possibility of price fluctuation of the underlying asset decreases.ã€€Change in option price divided by change in remaining days to maturity
