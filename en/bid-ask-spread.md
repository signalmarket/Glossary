Bid Ask Spread is the difference between the highest bid price (best bid quote) and the lowest offer price (best offer quote) of a trade. The smaller this difference is, the lower the transaction cost of buying and selling. A market with smaller transaction costs can also be said to be more liquid. The bid-ask spread is used as an indicator of the tightness of market liquidity. In the interbank foreign exchange market, it is the difference between the bid rate, which is the buying price of foreign exchange offered by a price quoter, and the ask rate, which is the selling price offered by a price quoter. Usually, the ask rate exceeds the bid rate. For example, if the yen/dollar exchange rate is quoted at 100.10-100.20 yen per dollar, the bid-ask spread is 10.00 yen, the difference between the bid rate of 100.10 yen and the ask rate of 110.20 yen.
