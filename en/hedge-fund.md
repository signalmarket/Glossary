A hedge fund is a fund that aims to pursue profits whether the market is going up or down by utilizing various trading techniques. The literal translation of the word "hedge" means "to avoid," and is used to avoid a loss of assets when the market falls. Most ordinary mutual funds have restrictions on how they are managed, and most of them only make profits when the market moves in one direction. Hedge funds, on the other hand, can be managed relatively freely and profit regardless of market ups and downs by actively utilizing futures and margin trading. The basic principle of hedge funds is to actively invest while hedging risks.
