An indicator that estimates the change in a bond's price when interest rates change. Adjusted duration is a well-known measure of interest rate risk for bonds. Convexity is a better approximation and is used as a complementary indicator to modified duration. When interest rate changes are large, bonds with higher convexity are considered more advantageous to investors.
