kurtosis is a measure of the sharpness of the probability density function or frequency distribution of a random variable. Compared to a normal distribution, a distribution with a large kurtosis has sharp peaks and a long, thick base, while a distribution with a small kurtosis has more rounded peaks and a short, thin tail. The Japanese Industrial Standard defines kurtosis as the ratio of the fourth-order moment μ4 around the mean to the fourth power of the standard deviation σ, μ4/σ4[1][2].
