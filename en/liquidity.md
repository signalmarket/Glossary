Liquidity is a measure of the number of stocks and other financial instruments that are available on the market, with a large number of stocks and other financial instruments being highly liquid. The more liquidity there is, the more likely it is that a large number of investors will hold positions in these instruments, and thus will place buy and sell orders based on their own agendas, influenced by the market's movements. This makes it easy to place buy and sell orders for any market movement. Such a situation is described as high liquidity.
