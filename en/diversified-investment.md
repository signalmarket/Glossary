Diversification" is a method of investing in multiple stocks without standardizing the assets, regions, industries, or timing of investments. If you invest in a single stock all at once, if you buy a stock when its price is high and it subsequently crashes, it may directly lead to a significant decline in your assets. There is an investment adage that says, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket," and if you divide your eggs into several baskets instead of one, then if one of the baskets breaks, the eggs in the remaining baskets will remain intact. For example, if you combine two investments that have completely different price movements, if one of them goes down, you may be able to cover it if the other one rises more strongly than it did. The advantage of "diversified investment" is that you can reduce the risk of price fluctuations in your investments by investing in a variety of investments at different times.
