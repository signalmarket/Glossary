title: duration

Duration has two meanings: first, it indicates the average payback period of the principal in a fixed income investment (in "years"). It is calculated by taking the total present value of interest and redemption proceeds (cash flows) that can be received in the future, multiplying the period until each cash flow is received by the percentage of the total present value of the cash flows, and summing the result. Generally, for the same coupon, the longer the remaining maturity of the bond, the longer the duration. For the same remaining maturity, a bond with a lower coupon will have a longer duration. The other meaning is as an indicator of the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates. In general, the greater the volatility of a bond's price in response to changes in interest rates, the greater the duration.
