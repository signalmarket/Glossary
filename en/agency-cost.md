An agency problem is a conflict of interest problem that arises between a client (Principal) and an agent (Agent). Inefficiencies arising from the fact that the agent does not always perform its duties as the client intends are called agency costs. The relationship between a company's shareholders (client) and management (agent) is a typical agency relationship, and the concept of corporate governance is important to minimize this agency cost.
