Mean reversion is a translation of Mean Reversion, and refers to the tendency of an exchange rate to return to its mean once it has swung sharply. Mean reversion can be thought of as a moving average, but it can also be a theoretical price, such as purchasing power parity (see article: Purchasing Power Parity Theory).
