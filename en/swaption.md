A term coined by combining the words "swap" and "option." It refers to an option transaction in which the underlying asset is the right to enter into a swap transaction under certain conditions on the exercise date. The underlying asset is mostly an interest rate swap, and there are two types of swap transactions: one is a swap transaction with a fixed interest rate and a floating interest rate (payer swaption), and the other is a swap transaction with a fixed interest rate and a floating interest rate (receiver swaption). Buyers usually use them to fix costs and avoid the risk of future increases in floating interest rates, while sellers use them for the expectation of yield.
