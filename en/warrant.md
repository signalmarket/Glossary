Also referred to as warrant securities, these are securities that entitle the holder to acquire shares of the issuing company at a fixed price (exercise price) and within a set period of time (exercise period). In April 2002, the name "warrant bonds" (a non-separate type of warrant bond) and convertible bonds, which were issued prior to the revision of the Commercial Code, were unified into "warrant bonds" in accordance with the revision of the Commercial Code.
