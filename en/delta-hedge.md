A method of avoiding (hedging) the risk of option price fluctuations based on the delta value in options trading. By trading options and the underlying asset together, the gain or loss from fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset and the gain or loss from fluctuations in the price of the options are offset to reduce the overall gain or loss to zero. When trading, the number of shares of the underlying asset (or futures contract) corresponding to the number of options traded is calculated based on the delta value of the options. In practice, however, even if this method is used to neutralize the fluctuation of the option price from the fluctuation of the underlying asset price, the overall profit/loss will be affected by other factors, such as volatility and remaining period, because the option price also moves due to other factors besides the fluctuation of the underlying asset price.
