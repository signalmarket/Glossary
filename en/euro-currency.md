Euro Currency is the currency that is subject to international interbank transactions in the offshore market and other Euro markets. The Euromarket is a market outside the control of the country that issues the currency. Currencies traded include, for example, the Swiss franc, the euro euro traded outside the European Union, and the U.S. dollar, known as the eurodollar. Eurocurrency securitization accelerated in the 1980s, and in the 1990s, as the Bank of Japan increased its foreign exchange reserves, Euroyen (yuroyen) was supplied to the market. This Euroyen was invested by institutional investors in Japanese companies issuing Euroyen bonds. LIBOR is a representative Eurocurrency interest rate, and Euroyen TIBOR for Euroyen.
