A situation in which the supply of funds in financial markets shrinks and the liquidity of funds is tightened due to the deterioration of the management of financial institutions as a result of the disposal of non-performing loans and other factors. When financing becomes difficult due to a credit crisis, corporate economic activity stagnates and the economy slumps, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further credit crises. In Japan, this refers to the situation after the bursting of the bubble economy in the early 1990s and the collapse of major financial institutions around 1998, and in the United States, it refers to the situation after the housing bubble burst in 2007.
