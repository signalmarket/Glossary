title: Market segmentation hypothesis

The Market Segmentation Hypothesis is a hypothesis about the term structure of interest rates. Since different investors and financing companies have different investment/financing term preferences, the market is assumed to be segmented for each remaining maturity, and interest rates are assumed to be determined independently according to the supply and demand of bonds for each remaining maturity. The shape of the yield curve is determined by the supply-demand relationship for each remaining maturity. Financial institutions that invest in bonds invest in bonds with different maturities because of the nature and nature of their business and because they have different preferences for the maturity of the bonds. For example, commercial banks tend to prefer short-term bonds, while life insurance companies tend to prefer long-term bonds. In this case, even if the price of a bond with a particular maturity is higher than that of a bond with another maturity and an arbitrage opportunity exists, financial institutions that prefer a particular maturity will not engage in arbitrage trading. Therefore, the yields on long-term and short-term bonds may be determined by the supply-demand relationship in their respective markets. If demand for short-term bonds is stronger than demand for long-term bonds, the shape of the yield curve will be forward yield.
