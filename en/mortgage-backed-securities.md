Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) are one of the asset-backed securities (ABS), and are issued with funds to repay the principal and interest of mortgage loans as the underlying assets. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are also called "mortgage-backed securities" or "MBS," which is an abbreviation for "Mortgage Backed Securities. In the U.S., many mortgage loans are securitized to diversify mortgage lending risk, and like U.S. Treasuries, they are important investment targets in the bond market. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) purchases securities called "Agency MBS", which are securities guaranteed by government housing finance companies such as Fannie Mae (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) for principal and interest payments. Japanese banks and insurance companies also hold these securities.
