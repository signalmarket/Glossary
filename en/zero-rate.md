Zero-rate, also called "spot rate" or "zero coupon rate," is the rate on a zero-coupon bond (discount bond) with no interest payments along the way. Specifically, it refers to the "compound yield of a discount bond or equivalent interest rate" that matures in a certain period of time after the current date. In general, the zero rate is used to discount future cash flows to present value because there are no interest payments along the way and no redeployment issues, and it is the basis for calculating the present value (theoretical value) of a financial instrument.
