Stratified sampling is a method of dividing a population into several strata and randomly sampling from among them. When there is a composition in the population, simple random sampling may not always allow the sample to represent the composition of the population well. The method of grouping the population according to some attributes by looking at the composition of the population and randomly sampling from among them is suitable.
