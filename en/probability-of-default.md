The probability, expressed as a percentage, that a lender will default on its loan within a certain period of time. The PD usually represents an estimated value, while the actual default rate is specifically referred to as the "actual default rate" to distinguish between the two. Usually, the PDs are for periods of one year or less, but for longer periods, the period may be specified as a 2-year PD, 5-year PD, and so on.
