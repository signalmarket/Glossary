A Bermudan option is an option with multiple chances to exercise. Those with only one chance to exercise are called European options. An American option is one that has only a start and end date for exercise, and can be exercised at any time during the business day of the exercise period. In contrast, Bermudan options are often exercisable on a regular basis, for example, every six months. They are named Bermudan because they are between European and American options, so to speak (in reference to the Bermuda Islands, which lie between Europe and the United States).
