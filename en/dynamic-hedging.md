An option trading method of hedging to avoid losses due to price fluctuations of the underlying asset. When investing in stock index options, there is delta hedging, which combines the buying and selling of the relevant stock index futures (underlying asset) in a ratio according to a risk indicator called delta. Dynamic hedging is a method that responds flexibly to price fluctuations of the underlying asset by repeatedly buying and selling the underlying asset required for delta hedging.
