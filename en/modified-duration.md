In addition to indicating the average payback period of a bond investment, duration also has the character of sensitivity, indicating the degree to which bond prices change when interest rates fluctuate by a certain percentage. A more direct expression of this is an indicator called modified duration. Adjusted duration is calculated by dividing duration by (1 + final yield). For example, a modified duration of 1 indicates that a 1% change in the final yield will result in a 1% change in the bond price. The larger the modified duration, the greater the rate of change in the bond price in response to changes in interest rates.
