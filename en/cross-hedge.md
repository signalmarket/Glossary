Cross hedging is a method of hedging risk by using another object that is not directly linked to the security to be hedged but has a high degree of correlation with it. For example, using government bond futures to hedge the risk of holding government-guaranteed bonds or corporate bonds (business bonds) is considered a cross hedge.
