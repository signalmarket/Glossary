Northern Rock is a bank based in the Regent's Center near Newcastle upon Tyne in northern England, United Kingdom. Formerly called Northern Rock Housing Finance Association, it became a bank in 1997 when that association distributed shares to those who had savings accounts or mortgages and listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, the bank was forced to take a special loan from the Bank of England due to credit market problems stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis. In November 2011, the bank was acquired by Virgin Money, a subsidiary of the Virgin Group led by Richard Branson.
