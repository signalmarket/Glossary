Since FX trading is available from anywhere in the world, trading is possible even if any country is closed for a national vacation, except for New Year's Day when all countries are closed and Christmas Day when most of the world (except for a few countries such as Japan) is closed. However, when major markets such as New York and London are closed, the number of traders drastically decreases, and the market may become unstable, with stalemate or sudden wild price movements.
