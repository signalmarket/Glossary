Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), commonly known as Ginnie Mae. A U.S. federal agency established under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and fully funded by the government. It supports federal housing programs by providing liquidity to the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market and attracting capital from the capital markets to the MBS market; it serves as a guarantor of principal and interest payments when MBS are sold to investors. Ginnie Mae does not hold the bonds, but guarantees the payment of principal and interest when the borrowers of the loans on which the MBS are structured default on principal and interest payments. Other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the U.S. that engage in the MBS business include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but they have been placed under public management due to the growing credit uncertainty caused by the 2008 financial crisis, and their future is uncertain as to whether they will be dismantled or continue to exist. Ginnie Mae is fully guaranteed by the U.S. federal government, whereas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not. In addition, Ginnie Mae does not hold any debt, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase and securitize debt.
