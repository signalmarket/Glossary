title: Implicit method

The implicit method is a type of time history response analysis that finds the response at each time point and solves the equations of motion for a future state (time: t + âŠ¿t). Nonlinear analysis requires iterative calculations using the Newton-Raphson method and also requires the inverse matrix of the nonlinear stiffness matrix [K], which has the weakness of high computational cost. In addition, convergence of the solution is not guaranteed for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, it has the advantage of taking large time steps for problems that do not deform greatly in a short time.
