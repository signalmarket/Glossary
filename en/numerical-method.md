Many mathematical theories assert the existence of solutions but do not indicate how to find them, such as "an equation of this form always has one real root between a and b" or "a differential equation satisfying these conditions always has one solution such that y = b when x = a. In such cases, the method of actually finding an approximate value of the root or an approximate solution close to the solution by actual calculation based on the theory of approximate computation is called the numerical computation method. In addition, approximations to definite integrals are sometimes obtained using trapezoidal formulas, Simpson's formula, etc., which are called numerical integrals. With the development of computers, numerical integration is becoming an important branch of mathematics. Although it can be said to be a synonym for numerical analysis, numerical analysis generally includes theoretical aspects, whereas it is often used with a more practical and concrete nuance.
