A constant maturity swap (CMS) is a swap contract in which the swap interest rate, which is a long-term interest rate, is used for either receiving or paying. The characteristic feature of a CMS is that it uses the current rate of the long-term market swap interest rate as of each interest rate determination date, whereas a plain interest rate swap contract generally exchanges a short-term market interest rate (e.g., 6-month LIBOR) corresponding to the calculation period as a floating rate for a fixed interest rate. The swap interest rate, which is a long-term fixed interest rate, fluctuates from day to day, but the contract is for delivery at the long-term interest rate at the current market rate at a certain date in the future, which can also be called a long-term floating interest rate.
