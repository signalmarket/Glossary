Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a business for the purpose of securitization or project finance. It is also called a special purpose entity or SPE (Special Purpose Entity). SPCs provide a means to deconsolidate or off-balance sheet an originator or other entity. The shadow banking system is a form of OTD finance that was repeated in the wake of Enron's window dressing, the Livedoor scandal, and the global financial crisis, for example. The shadow banking system relies very strongly on SPCs[1].
