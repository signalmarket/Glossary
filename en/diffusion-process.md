A Markov process whose sample functions are continuous is called a diffusion process. It is so called because the model is based on the diffusion of a physical phenomenon. Suppose a container is filled with water and a small amount of colored colloidal particles are dissolved in it, but the concentration is not uniform. If the water is left to stand, the particles move irregularly but tend to spread from the higher concentration to the lower concentration, and finally become uniformly distributed throughout the water. Brownian motion is the most important example of a diffusion process that models this phenomenon.
