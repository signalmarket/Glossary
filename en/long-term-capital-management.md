Long-Term Capital Management (English: LTCM) is a hedge fund that existed from 1994 to 1999. It was formerly headquartered in Connecticut. The management team included Nobel Prize winners in economics such as Myron Scholes, and by making full use of advanced financial engineering theories, LTCM recorded phenomenal performance in the first few years after its establishment. However, because of the enormous leverage they used to profit from the small difference in interest rates on the bonds they traded[1], they were unable to absorb the massive market fluctuations that occurred as a result of the Asian currency crisis, and collapsed[2].
