title: dispersion effect

It is the effect of different factors' fluctuations weakening each other or canceling each other out. The expected return of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns of its component stocks, weighted by the investment ratio. This is called the "additivity of averages. The average of several components mixed together equals the average of each component added together. However, this is not the case for risk, or standard deviation. The standard deviation of a mix of different factors is usually smaller than the weighted average of the standard deviations of the individual factors. In other words, by putting together a portfolio, the expected return can be averaged and the risk can be smaller than the average. How much smaller depends on how independently and discretely the component stocks move. Looking at it the other way around, if we know how well they move in tandem with each other, we can determine the size of the diversification effect.
