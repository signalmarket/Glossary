title: Explicit method
tags:

The explicit method is a type of time history response analysis that determines the response at each time point and directly (explicitly) solves the equations of motion for the current state (time: t). Since it does not require convergence calculations, it can stably obtain solutions even for highly nonlinear dynamic problems. Generally, this method is used for problems with large deformation in a short period of time or problems involving fracture or delamination.
