Securitization is the pooling and securitization of multiple loans of the same type. By selling the securitized securities to investors, the financial institutions holding the claims can raise funds based on the claims. Mortgage-backed securities are a typical example. Generally, they are guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, have high credit quality, and are widely circulated.
