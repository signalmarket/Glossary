An equity swap is a transaction in which cash flows linked to a stock price are exchanged for a pre-agreed interest rate. The cash flow linked to the stock price is a specific stock price or a stock index such as the S&P 500. The investor receiving the stock price return has the risk of stock price fluctuation, but can earn the stock price return when the stock price rises without having to own the stock in question.
