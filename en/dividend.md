A dividend is a distribution of profits by a company to its shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they own. Normally, dividends are distributed at the end of the fiscal year, but in years of exceptionally large profits or in commemorative years, dividends may be added to or differentiated from regular dividends, such as special dividends or commemorative dividends. Dividends are not always paid and may not be paid in the event of a loss or depending on the company's policies.
