In cash futures trading, the open interest for the current month contract will be traded on the last day of trading (or the delivery date, hereinafter the same except for early delivery).  If the open interest of the current month contract is not settled by the end of the day session on the last trading day (or delivery day) of the month (hereinafter the same except for early delivery), and the open interest of the current month contract is still held, physical delivery will be made. This type of delivery is called "basic delivery," and other flexible delivery systems include "early delivery," "declared delivery," "delivery condition adjustment," and the "ADP system. In addition, there is a "Voluntary Delivery System" as a special exception for the settlement of contract day cash-settled futures contracts (Gold Contract Day Futures and Platinum Contract Day Futures).
