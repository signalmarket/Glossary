The National Futures Association (NFA) is a self-regulatory organization of member organizations in the futures industry in the U.S. It was designated in 1981 as a registered futures association under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1981. The NFA audits the operations of its members, arbitrates disputes with customers, and registers and screens members and their employees for eligibility with the CFTC. In addition, registered members are required by NFA rules to strictly adhere to ethical standards and broker protection principles, as well as regulations governing solicitation and sales.
