The Levenberg-Marquardt method is a type of iterative method for finding the minimum of a function expressed in the form of a sum of squares of a nonlinear function. It is considered to be a combination of the steepest descent and Newton's method, and has become the standard method for solving nonlinear least-squares problems (problems to find the minimum of the sum of squares of a nonlinear function). It works like the steepest descent method, which is slow but guaranteed to converge if the current solution is far from the correct solution, and performs the Newton method if it is close to the correct solution.
