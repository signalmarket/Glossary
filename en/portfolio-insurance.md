Portfolio assurance is an investment technique that ensures that the value of a portfolio will not fall below a certain value in the future. A typical example is a method to achieve the following objectives by dynamically changing the ratio of risky assets such as stocks and bonds to risk-free assets such as cash, based on option theory. (1)To ensure that the portfolio returns the minimum return initially set even if the price of risky assets such as stocks declines. (2) When the price of a risky asset such as stocks rises, the portfolio will ensure a return that follows it to some extent. Therefore, such an approach is to create a protective put, which is one of the option strategies.
