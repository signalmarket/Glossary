Subprime loans are mortgages for borrowers with poor credit in the United States. Loan companies make it easier for borrowers to borrow by using their houses or cars as collateral, applying a low fixed interest rate for the first few years, or requiring only interest payments. However, after that, the fixed interest rate shifts to a variable rate or the monthly repayments increase as the principal begins to be repaid, making these loans with high interest rates unsuitable for people whose incomes are not expected to increase.
