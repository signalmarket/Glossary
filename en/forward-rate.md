The forward rate is the interest rate applicable to a period starting at a future point in time. This concept usually corresponds to the "forward price" and refers to the level of the interest rate when the interest rate applicable to a period starting at a future point in time is determined at this point in time. It does not refer to the future level of the spot interest rate. The theoretical value of the forward rate is called the implied forward rate.
