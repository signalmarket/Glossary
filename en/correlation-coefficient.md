The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two data or random variables [1][2]. The correlation coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that takes a value between -1 and 1 as a real number. When the correlation coefficient is positive, the random variable has a positive correlation, and when it is negative, the random variable has a negative correlation. Also, when the correlation coefficient is 0, the random variable is said to be uncorrelated [3][4]. For example, unemployment rates and real economic growth rates in developed countries are strongly negatively correlated, and the correlation coefficient is close to -1.
