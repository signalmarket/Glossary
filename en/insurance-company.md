There are two types of insurance companies: life insurance companies and non-life insurance companies. Insurance companies are licensed and operate under the Insurance Business Law, which defines the scope of their business. Insurance companies are also powerful institutional investors because they invest the funds they receive in the form of insurance premiums by lending and investing in securities. In order to implement financial liberalization in the insurance sector as well, the new Insurance Business Law enacted in 1996 allows insurance companies to engage in both life and non-life insurance business, which was not allowed before, and to establish subsidiaries for mutual participation. As the business environment for insurance companies has changed due to the increasing complexity of insurance products and diversification of sales formats, the revised Insurance Business Law went into effect in May 2016, establishing basic rules for insurance solicitation and introducing the obligation to develop a system for insurance solicitors (agents, etc.).
