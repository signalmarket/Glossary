The International Standards on Capital Adequacy Ratio and Liquidity Ratio for Internationally Active Banks. The standards were established in 1988 to strengthen the soundness of the international banking system and to reduce competitive inequalities among banks engaged in international operations. The standards set out how banks' capital adequacy ratios should be measured and the minimum level to be achieved (8% or more). In Japan, Basel I was fully applied from the end of fiscal year 1992.
