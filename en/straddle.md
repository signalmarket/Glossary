An options trading technique that combines call and put options with the same strike price in the same contract month. A long straddle (buying a straddle), in which an equal number of call and put options with the same strike price are bought, is taken when the market is expected to fluctuate more or less, while a short straddle (selling a straddle), in which an equal number of call and put options with the same strike price are sold, is taken when the market is expected to fluctuate only within a narrow range. A short straddle (selling a straddle) is used when the market is expected to move only within a narrow range.
