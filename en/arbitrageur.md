An arbitrager is an investor who specializes in arbitrage (saya trading). Arbitrage trading is a type of trading that takes advantage of price differences between different markets for the same commodity to make a profit. For example, if there is a price difference between futures and cash, you can sell the higher price and buy the lower price to profit from the price difference. Theoretically, the prices of futures and cash should converge, so you can take a position when the price difference between the two widens, and then buy or sell the opposite position when the price difference between the two closes, thereby making a profit.
