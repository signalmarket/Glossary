The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is an organization created by agreement at a meeting of the central bank governors of the G10 (Group of Ten) countries to discuss and determine international rules covering financial institutions and to provide ongoing cooperation. It consists of central banks and banking supervisors from 28 countries and regions, including Japan, and has a secretariat within the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. In order to strengthen the soundness and risk tolerance of internationally active banks, Basel 1 was established in 1988 as an international standard for capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, which was reviewed as Basel 2 in 2004, and Basel 3 was published in 2010 as a new regulation (to be fully implemented in 2027).
