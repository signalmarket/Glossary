A Markov process is a stochastic process with Markovian characteristics. That is, it is a stochastic process with the property that its future behavior is determined only by its present value and is independent of its past behavior. Such a process can be seen, for example, in the time evolution of physical phenomena that can only be described stochastically. This is because the future behavior of a particle is determined only by its current behavior, a property that carries over to situations where the number of particles in the system increases and stochastic analysis is required. Named after the Russian mathematician Andrei Markov.
