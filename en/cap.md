A type of interest rate option. In a cap, the seller of the cap promises to pay the buyer of the cap an amount equivalent to the excess interest rate if the target interest rate exceeds the cap rate, and the buyer of the cap pays the seller an option fee (premium). The buyer uses the cap to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates, while the seller uses it to increase its yield.
