The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock price average calculated by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. in the United States and is based on the stock prices of stocks in representative industries in the United States. There are several types of averages, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30, the Dow Jones Transportation Average of 20, and the Dow Jones Composite Average of 65. Not all stocks belong to the New York Stock Exchange, and representative high-tech stocks such as Intel and Microsoft belong to NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tends to have a significant impact on the Nikkei Stock Average.
