Federally insured savings account. They are usually available at banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations (S&Ls). They are highly liquid, usually allow up to three checks per month, and are highly stable because they focus on short-term securities with maturities of less than one year. Unlike money market funds (MMFs), MMAs are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, MMAs have very low yields, and if you are not careful, inflation may cause a loss of your investment principal.
