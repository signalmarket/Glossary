Liquidity risk refers to the possibility that a transaction will not be executed due to extremely low trading volume and that you may not be able to sell when you want to sell. Liquidity risk refers to the possibility that a company may not be able to sell its shares when it wants to, due to extremely low trading volume. For example, if a company delists its shares due to a corporate scandal, the trading volume of the company's shares may decrease so much that the shares cannot be sold because they are not priced. Delisting does not extinguish a company's right to receive dividends or shareholder voting rights, unless the company goes bankrupt. However, once a company is delisted, its shares can no longer be traded on the market, and investors rush to sell their shares, resulting in a flood of sell orders and making it difficult to get a price for the shares.
