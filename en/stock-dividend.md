A dividend is a distribution of profits by a company to its shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they own. Normally, dividends are distributed at the end of the fiscal year, but in years of exceptionally large profits or company anniversaries, dividends may be added to or differentiated from regular dividends, such as special dividends or commemorative dividends.
