It is the ratio of the amount of a bank loan to the appraised value of real estate to be acquired using that loan, and is one of the items that banks and other financial institutions examine when making real estate loans. A research paper by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has drawn attention to the fact that macroprudential policies regulating LTV ratios, etc. are more effective in preventing bubbles than traditional interest rate manipulation. As shadow banking and other non-bank financial institutions have developed in many countries, it has become impossible to curb real estate lending by non-bank institutions by raising interest rates alone.
