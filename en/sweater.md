This is one of the risk indicators when investing in options and indicates the change in premium (option price) due to a change in the remaining days to maturity. In other words, the higher the value of theta, the greater the decrease in premium when the remaining days decrease by one day. Always shown as a negative value, the number represents the actual option price, which decreases daily and is zero at maturity. Other typical risk indicators for options include delta, gamma, and vega.
