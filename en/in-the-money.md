Abbreviated name = ITM, which refers to the relationship between the strike price and the price of the underlying instrument, whereby a profit is generated when the buyer of an option transaction exercises his/her right. In a call option, the strike price is below the price of the underlying instrument; in a put option, the strike price is above the price of the underlying instrument. A situation where the strike price is significantly below (call) or above (put) the price of the underlying instrument is also called deep-in-the-money.
