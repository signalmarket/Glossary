The amount paid by the buyer to the seller in an options transaction. Also called "option fee" or "option price". The buyer can obtain the right to the option in exchange for a premium. In exchange for receiving the premium, the seller is obligated to respond if the buyer exercises the right. The premium varies depending on the price of the underlying asset, volatility (magnitude of price fluctuation), strike price, and strike period. Apart from options trading, a premium is the price added to the market value when purchasing shares from the market in a takeover bid (TOB) or management buyout (MBO). A larger premium is expected to have the effect of attracting more shares to be purchased.
