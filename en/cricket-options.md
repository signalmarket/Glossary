Also called ratchet options. This is an option on the return on the stock price. The basic form of the payoff is max(S(T2)/S(T1) - 1 - K, 0). Cricket options are common in equity instruments, as equity market participants look at the return rather than the absolute level of the stock price. The form of the payoff indicates that this is an option on the average change in the stock price. Cricket options are usually a portfolio of options on the above returns. A common product is a series of options on three-month returns. For a two-year maturity, this would consist of 4 x 2 for a total of 8 options.
