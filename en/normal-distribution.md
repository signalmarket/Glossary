The normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is one of the probability distributions for continuous variables used in probability theory and statistics [1]. It represents a distribution in which the data are clustered around the mean value. The main characteristics of Gaussian distribution are that the mean, mode, and median coincide with each other, and that it is symmetrical with the mean value at the center[1][2].
