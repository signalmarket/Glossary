A transaction in which a computer system automatically determines the timing and quantity of stock purchase and sales orders according to the stock price and trading volume, and repeats the orders. Specifically, the system distributes buy and sell orders so that the stock price does not fluctuate wildly due to its own trading, and automatically issues buy orders when it judges that the stock price is undervalued. In general, investors select the most suitable execution strategy (algorithm) from multiple execution strategies provided by securities firms at the time of order placement.
