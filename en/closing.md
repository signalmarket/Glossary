To settle a transaction by counter-purchase or counter-sale in margin trading. I bought a stock on margin when the stock price was low and the price has risen considerably. I want to think carefully about whether to make a profit by selling the shares on margin or buying more shares. Settling a margin transaction is called "Handing in. Selling all of your stocks or investment trusts is also sometimes called "parting with your money. In margin trading, if you "buy on margin," which is to borrow money to buy stocks, you are closing the transaction by selling, and the investor's profit or loss is determined. In this case, the opposite of a buy is called an opposite transaction, and the opposite of a "margin sale" of borrowed shares is called a "buy" or "repurchase" transaction. When the market fails to meet expectations, it is considered the best way to manage risk to promptly close the position and prevent losses from increasing.
