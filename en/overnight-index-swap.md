OIS is a type of swap that exchanges a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate of interest and references the next-day interest rate instead of LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) as the floating rate. In Japan, the OIS rate, which is a fixed rate, is exchanged for an unsecured call O/N rate (compounded) for a fixed period of time as the floating rate, and, like the unsecured call O/N rate, which is the reference rate, the credit risk of the banks involved is very limited, It has the following characteristics: it strongly reflects the market outlook for next-day interest rates, and the amount of variable interest to be received or paid is fixed on the maturity date of the interest calculation period. These characteristics make OIS suitable for widespread use for hedging and arbitrage purposes. When financial institutions use Japanese Yen OIS, they need to adopt appropriate methods according to their own asset/liability structure, and they also need to be prepared in terms of administration, systems, and accounting procedures.
