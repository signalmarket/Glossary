OTC options are options that are traded through relative transactions in over-the-counter markets such as securities firms without going through a financial instruments exchange. Typical examples include bond options with the right of choice (OTC bond options), where the trading period is limited to one year and three months and the trading price can be freely agreed between the parties to the transaction, currency options, caps, and floors, which are rights to buy or sell foreign exchange under specific trading conditions such as strike price and maturity date, and interest rate options, such as caps and floors. Interest rate options such as caps and floors are also available.
