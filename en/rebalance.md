Rebalancing is a method of adjusting the composition of a portfolio to the same ratio as at the beginning by reviewing the investment allocation ratio that has changed due to market fluctuations after the portfolio has been constructed (actual inclusion of investment targets), selling assets and stocks that have increased in value and buying more assets and stocks that have decreased in value.
