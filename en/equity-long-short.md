It is an investment technique in which stocks that are considered undervalued are bought while stocks that are considered overvalued are sold through margin transactions, etc. Long means buying and short means selling. This is one of the typical investment methods used by hedge funds, and some publicly offered mutual funds also use this method as their investment policy. It is often applied by pairing undervalued and overvalued stocks in the same industry and tilting the ratio of buying and selling to one side or the other, so as to accumulate small returns without being affected by the rise and fall of the stock market. The results may backfire. There is also an investment technique called market neutral, which is an application of long-short equity.
