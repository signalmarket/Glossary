A dirty price is when the bond price includes interest accrued since the last coupon payment. For prospective investors and many others, it is important to distinguish between bonds and stocks when an investor purchases bonds such as fixed income securities. Two of the most common asset classes of investment expect to receive coupon payments based on a fixed schedule. However, the price of a bond depends on the present value of future coupon payments. Unless the bond is purchased on the coupon payment date, the price of the bond may include interest accrued since then. Thus, the buyer misses one coupon payment and the seller pockets the accrued interest. This results in a dirty price. This is in contrast to a clean price that excludes accrued interest.
