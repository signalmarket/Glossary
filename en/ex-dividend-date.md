title: ex dividend date

The loss of the right to receive dividends. Or, after the right is vested, the stock price falls by the amount of the dividend. Dividends are paid to shareholders registered in the shareholder registry as of the vesting date (which is often the same day as the settlement of accounts), so shareholders registered in the shareholder registry after the vesting date will not be entitled to receive dividends for that period. The "final date of entitlement" is two business days prior to the vesting date set by the company issuing the shares, and the "ex-rights date" is one business day prior to the vesting date. On the ex-rights date, the share price theoretically falls by the amount of the dividend. However, since the stock price is also affected by other variable factors, the stock price may not always change according to the theory.
