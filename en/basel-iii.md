Basel III (Basel III, the third Basel Accord or Basel standards) is a global, but discretionary, regulatory framework for bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk. It is the third Basel Accord (see Basel I and Basel II) and was developed as a response to the financial regulatory deficiencies that came to light during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The objective is to strengthen capital adequacy requirements for banks in order to improve liquidity and reduce bank leverage. Basel III was agreed upon among the member countries of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in November 2010 and was to be implemented from 2013 to 2015. However, implementation was repeatedly extended to March 31, 2019 and then re-extended to January 1, 2023[1][2][3].
