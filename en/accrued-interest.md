When buying or selling an interest-bearing bond, if the delivery date differs from the interest payment date of the bond, the buyer pays to the seller an amount equivalent to interest calculated on a daily basis for the number of days from the day following the previous interest payment date to the delivery date (number of days elapsed). This interest portion is referred to as accrued interest or accrued interest. The accrued interest is usually not included in the purchase price. In this case, the purchase price is called the naked price, and the price that includes the accrued interest is called the interest-inclusive price.
