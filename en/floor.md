A type of interest rate option. A floor is a contract in which the seller of the floor promises to pay the buyer of the floor an amount equivalent to the excess falling interest rate if the subject interest rate falls below the floor rate, and the buyer of the floor pays the seller an option fee (premium). The buyer uses it to hedge the risk of falling interest rates and the seller uses it to reduce costs.
