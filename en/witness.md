A trading floor is a place on an exchange where members gather at a certain time to buy and sell. Such a place used to be called an "auction floor," and was located within a securities exchange, where trading was executed by securities company market staff called "badachi," and by members who were takers. However, in order to speed up, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of trading, computerized trading systems gradually became the mainstay of trading, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange abolished the auction floor at the end of April 1999.
