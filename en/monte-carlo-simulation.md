Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical method of predicting the possible outcomes of uncertain events. Computer programs use this method to analyze historical data and predict various future outcomes based on selected actions. For example, to estimate the first month's sales of a new product, a Monte Carlo simulation program can be fed historical sales data. The program will estimate different sales based on factors such as general market conditions, product prices, and advertising budgets.
