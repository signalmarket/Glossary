In the United States, the abbreviation Merrill is primarily used. Originally, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. was one of the three largest investment banks in the United States and a financial institution with extensive international operations. It began as an investment bank and had operations in 37 countries and regions around the world, but effectively collapsed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and was acquired by Bank of America in a bailout on January 1, 2009.
