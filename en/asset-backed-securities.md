Asset Backed Securities (ABS) is a generic term for securities issued backed by assets such as commercial real estate loans, mortgage loans, automobile loans, leases, and monetary claims on credit cards. Asset-backed securities are typically issued through a securitization scheme in which a company transfers specific assets to a special purpose company (SPC), and the SPC issues securities backed by those assets. In Japan, trusts are often used instead of SPCs, and most ABSs are issued in the form of trust beneficiary interests. Those backed by monetary claims mainly held by non-banks, such as automobile loan claims, lease fee claims, and credit card claims, which are not classified as CDOs, are simply called ABSs (ABSs in a narrower sense).
