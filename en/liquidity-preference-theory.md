Liquidity preference is the preference of people for the liquidity of money and the demand for holding money as an asset (asset demand). According to the liquidity preference theory proposed by Keynes, when an asset is held in the form of bonds, interest is considered to be paid in exchange for giving up the liquidity that would have been gained by holding the asset in the form of money. Therefore, when bond prices are expected to rise (and interest rates to fall), people's preference for liquidity will decline. In other words, the asset demand for money is a decreasing function of the interest rate because the asset-motivated demand for money decreases as bond prices are expected to rise.
