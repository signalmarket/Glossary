The percentage of an investor's portfolio that is exposed to a specific risk that is directly involved. It is also used as a measure of sensitivity, meaning the degree of influence of market price fluctuations. Futures and beta are used to adjust exposure for stocks, while duration and convexity are used to adjust exposure for bonds.
