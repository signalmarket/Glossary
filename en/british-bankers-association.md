The British Bankers' Association (BBA) is one of the leading financial services business associations in the UK banking industry, with more than 240 members in 180 countries. The BBA used to be the main publisher of LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate for international financial transactions, but after fraud issues came to light, the U.S. exchange giant Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) took over the calculation and operation of LIBOR in February 2014.
