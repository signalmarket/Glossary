A hedge transaction is a transaction in which an investor takes an opposite position in a futures or options contract to avoid or reduce the risk of price fluctuations of a cash contract that the investor currently holds or intends to hold in the future. There are two types of hedging transactions: sell hedging, in which you sell a futures contract when you hold the cash, and buy hedging, in which you buy a futures contract when you plan to hold the cash in the future. For example, if you believe that a cash stock or fund you hold is likely to fall in price in the future, you can either sell futures or buy put options. If the price falls as expected, the cash stock or fund will incur a loss, but the loss can be covered by buying back the futures contract or trading the options against the futures contract to make a profit. On the other hand, if the price of the cash stock is likely to rise in the future and you want to acquire it, you can buy futures or call options in advance, and when the market price rises, you can sell the futures or reverse the call options and use the profit you make to acquire the cash stock.
