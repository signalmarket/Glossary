A correlation matrix is a sequence of correlation coefficients, which makes it a symmetric matrix by its very meaning. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the degree of similarity between two series and takes a value between -1 and 1. If the vectors are oriented in opposite directions, the correlation coefficient is -1, and if the vectors are orthogonal, the correlation coefficient is 0.
