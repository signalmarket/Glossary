LIBOR, which had been published by the British Bankers Association (BBA), was replaced by the Inter Continental Exchange (ICE) took over the operation. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, the IBA, the governing body of LIBOR, and its supervisory authority, the FCA, formally announced the permanent suspension of LIBOR publication and the loss of its indexation.
