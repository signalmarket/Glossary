Option to Expand (Option to Expand) is one of the real options. Specifically, it is the right to expand the scale of a project, such as increasing the production of goods and services or expanding into related industries, if the project proves to be successful, even though the realized value of future earnings is uncertain. It is also referred to as a growth option. The existence of an expansion option allows a company to increase its profit margin in the case of a successful project, which has a positive impact on the overall NPV of the project.
