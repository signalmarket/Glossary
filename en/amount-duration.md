Duration is the average maturity of the coupon and par value produced by a bond for an investor. Specifically, duration is the weighted average of the period of time until the investor receives the cash payments that the bond will generate. The weight for each year is the present value of the cash proceeds to be received at that point divided by the total present value of the bond.
