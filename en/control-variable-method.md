One of the variance reduction methods in Monte Carlo methods. For each unbiased estimator of the characteristic value to be estimated, a random variable whose expected value is known and correlated with the unbiased estimator is called a control variable. If the first-order combination of the unbiased estimator and the control variable is well constructed, the variance of the estimation can be reduced.
