A boundary condition is a constraint imposed on a boundary value problem. It is often used as a terminology, especially in mathematics and physics. Boundary conditions are set to separate the search area for solutions of interest from other areas in a boundary value problem. On the boundary, it is not possible to determine the form of the solution by the equations that exist inside the boundary alone, so it is necessary to define the solution by setting auxiliary conditions. These boundary conditions are often determined by the properties of the solution that are more generally true for the boundary value problem under consideration. It can be, for example, the value of the solution on the boundary, or the continuity or smoothness of the solution. One of the time boundary conditions is the initial condition. For equations describing time evolution, initial conditions are often mentioned separately from general boundary conditions because of their special significance in applications.
