The intrinsic value of an option is the value that would be obtained if the option were exercised immediately. For example, if the underlying asset price of a call option with a strike price of 50 yen that matures in three months is 60 yen, the intrinsic value is 10 (=60-50) yen. If the underlying asset price is 40 yen, the option is not exercised because exercising the right would result in a negative return. Therefore, the intrinsic value at this time is 0 yen. Even if the underlying asset price is 40 yen and the intrinsic value is 0 yen, the price may rise until maturity and exceed the strike price at maturity. Even if the intrinsic value of the option is zero, the option is valuable only to the extent that it can generate income from future price fluctuations, and this value is called the time value of the option. The option price (premium) is the sum of the intrinsic value and the time value.
