Currency futures are futures contracts whose underlying asset is a foreign exchange rate, which is the buying or selling price of one currency for another currency. Specifically, it is a transaction in which a specific currency is exchanged (bought or sold) for another currency at a predetermined foreign exchange rate at a certain date in the future. In 1972, currency futures were listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and began trading. At that time, the seven listed instruments were the British pound, Canadian dollar, German mark, Italian lira, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Mexican peso, and their exchange rates against the US dollar. However, the number of currencies has gradually increased since then.
