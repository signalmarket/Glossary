Liffe, formerly the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, is a financial exchange specializing in derivatives. It was established in 1982 and offered financial futures, equity index futures, bond futures, and commodity futures. In 2002, Liffe joined the Euronext group (which merged the Paris, Amsterdam, and Brussels Futures Exchanges in 2000 and later added Lisbon) and became a brand of the group's derivatives-related business. In 2007, the NYSE Group and Euronext Group, which owned the New York Stock Exchange, merged to form NYSE Euronext, which was renamed NY Liffe. In 2013, NYSE Euronext was acquired by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and NY Liffe was merged into ICE Futures Europe.
