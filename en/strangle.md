An options trading technique that combines call and put options with different strike prices in the same contract month. A long strangle (buy strangle), in which an equal number of out-of-the-money call and put options are bought, is a strategy that is used to anticipate whether the market will move or not, regardless of the direction of the market. A short strangle (sell strangle) is used when the market is expected to move only within a narrow range.
