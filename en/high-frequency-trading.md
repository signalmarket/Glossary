Also called High Frequency Trading (HFT), this type of trading involves the use of a computer to determine movements in stock prices and trading volume on a millisecond (1/1000th of a second) or less basis and repeat automated orders at ultra-high speed to buy or sell large volumes. The holding period of a position is extremely short, and by increasing the frequency of transactions, the capital turnover rate is increased, aiming for high profits. It accounts for a large percentage of trading in the stock and futures markets, and is sometimes viewed critically because of its ability to cause instantaneous market fluctuations.
