An over-the-counter bond transaction in which it is agreed in advance that bonds will be delivered at a certain time in the future under certain conditions. A type of futures contract where the period from the execution date to the delivery date is one month or longer. A customer's purchase is called a "buy landing" (landing) and a sale is called a "sell landing" (reverse landing). Transactions in which a brokerage firm acts as the seller of a bond are called "landings," while those in which it acts as the buyer are called "reverse landings. There was a time when this type of trading was very active, but now, with the development of the bond futures market and other markets, risk hedging has become easier, and trading has become less frequent.
