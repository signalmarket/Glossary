In statistics, a copula is a function that expresses the relationship between a multivariate cumulative distribution function and its marginal distribution function. While the correlation coefficient is a representative indicator of the correlation between random variables, the correlation coefficient is a single numerical value, whereas a copula is a function. The name "copula" is derived from the Latin noun copula, meaning "connection" or "association" between two different things. The word was originally used in music and linguistics, but was first used in statistics when Abe Sklar published it in the Statistical Institute of the University of Paris in 1959[1].
