title: efficient market hypothesis
tags:

It is a translation of the Efficient-market hypothesis, a theory that all available new information is immediately incorporated into the stock market at the present time, that excess returns (returns in excess of the returns commensurate with the risks taken by investors) cannot be earned, and that stock prices cannot be predicted. The theory is that all new information available in the stock market at this point in time is immediately factored in.
