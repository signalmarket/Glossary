Basis risk is the risk that profits and losses will fluctuate due to a divergence between two highly interlinked financial instruments. A typical example is the price divergence between the futures market and the cash market. When futures are traded to hedge the risk of the cash market, the risk of fluctuations in profit or loss due to this basis is called basis risk.
