It was a global stock market crash that originated in Hong Kong on Monday, October 19, 1987. The U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell exactly 508 points (22.6%). This was the largest single-day decline on record. Heavy selling caused sharp price declines throughout the day, especially in the last hour and a half of trading; the S&P 500 Index and the Wilshire 5000 Index each fell more than 18%, and S&P 500 futures fell 29%. The total volume of trading was so great that the computer and communications systems of the time were not functioning, and orders were delayed for more than an hour. Massive fund transfers were delayed for hours, and the Fedwire and NYSE DOT systems were down for extended periods, adding to traders' confusion.
