It is often used in modern portfolio theory as a measure of how sensitive the return of an individual security (or portfolio) fluctuates in response to movements in the securities market as a whole. For example, a stock with a beta of 1.5 means that if the overall market rises 10%, the stock will rise 15%; conversely, if the overall market falls 10%, the stock will fall 15%. Therefore, it can be considered as a risk indicator, and is used to select stocks when judging that the market as a whole will rise, investing in stocks with a high beta value, or setting the beta value of the entire portfolio at "1" to link it to the market as a whole, for example. In the case of regression analysis, in which data on one variable y (explained variable) is predicted from data on another variable x (explanatory variable) and verified by applying the relationship y = α + βx, β = (covariance between x and y) / (variance of x) is estimated using the least squares method.
