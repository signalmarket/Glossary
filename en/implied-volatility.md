title: Implied Volatility

It is the rate of change (volatility) of the underlying asset calculated from the actual traded option price, also known as the "expected volatility". It increases in anticipation of stock price fluctuations when important economic indicators change significantly or when political unrest occurs. As options trading is also known as "volatility trading," volatility is an important measure of an option's value. However, high volatility does not mean that the stock price is likely to move in a particular direction. Typically, option pricing models assume an equal degree of probability of fluctuation in either direction, up or down.
