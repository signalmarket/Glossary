Even in a situation where you have found a stock with a high probability of rising, but you do not have enough funds to purchase it, and it will be some time before you can invest additional funds, you can fix in advance that you will buy the stock at the current price by using margin purchase and subsequent cash settlement. This is the technique of buying hedging.
