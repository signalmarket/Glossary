Generally, securities issued backed by real estate secured loan receivables. The originator, a mortgage lender, lends the mortgage loan and sells the mortgage loan receivable to the securities issuer. The securities issuer issues mortgage-backed securities based on the loan. The securities are then sold to investors with enhanced credit quality and ratings, including guarantees of principal and interest payments. In the United States, the majority of mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-affiliated agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Mortgage-backed securities have high credit quality comparable to that of U.S. government bonds. However, they are subject to prepayment risk, which allows investors to enjoy a relatively higher yield than a typical bond. A typical example of a mortgage-backed security is a pass-through security. There are those issued by both government and private issuers. They can be further classified into those with fixed interest rates and those with floating interest rates. There are also bonds called CMOs and RMBS.
