In order to prevent rapid fluctuations in stock prices, which may mislead investors into making investment decisions and cause unforeseen damage, the Exchange limits the range of daily price fluctuation to a certain range above or below a base price determined based on the closing price or quote of the previous day. A price rise to the upper limit of the price range is called a "stop high" and a fall to the lower limit is called a "stop low.
