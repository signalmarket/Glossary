title: Sharpe ratio

It measures the excess return per unit of risk (excess return over the return that could be obtained with zero risk). The higher this number is, the higher the excess return obtained by taking a risk (i.e., the more efficiently the return was obtained). It is useful when comparing different investments to determine which returns are higher for the same risk. The Sharpe ratio is also used to evaluate the investment performance of mutual funds as a measure of risk-adjusted return.
