The share exchange ratio refers to the ratio of shares of the parent company allocated to the shareholders of the subsidiary in proportion to their shareholdings when the parent company makes the subsidiary a wholly owned subsidiary through a share exchange. For example, if parent company A makes subsidiary B a wholly owned subsidiary through a share exchange, and the shareholders of subsidiary B receive 10.5 shares of Company A stock for every 21 shares of Company B stock, the share exchange ratio is 1 to 0.5.
