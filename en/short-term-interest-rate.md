Short-term interest rates are interest rates with a trading period of less than one year (a few days to a few months). The Japanese short-term money market includes call rates, CD quotes, CP quotes, and Treasury bill yields, among which the unsecured call rate next day is a representative indicator. It also refers to interest rates on time deposits and savings deposits of less than one year. Short-term interest rates are largely determined by the volume of funds in the market, and the Bank of Japan sets the Next Day Uncollateralized Call Rate as the policy interest rate to control and guide the level of interest rates to a certain level.
