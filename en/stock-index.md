A stock price index is a measure of the movement of the stock price of an exchange as a whole or of a specific group of stocks. Stock price indices are expressed as an increase or decrease based on the stock price at a certain point in time. This allows for a long-term evaluation of the stock price movements of the target exchange or group of stocks, while maintaining continuity when viewed in a time series. Representative Japanese stock price indices include the Nikkei 225 (Nikkei Stock Average) and TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index). In addition, a new stock price index, the JPX Nikkei Index 400, consisting of 400 TSE stocks, has been available since January 6, 2014. Stock price indices are not only used as indices for stock trading, but also as benchmarks for mutual funds and as underlying assets for futures and options trading.
