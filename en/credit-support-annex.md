A Credit Support Annex (CSA) is a collateral agreement for a derivative financial instrument (derivative) transaction. It is a collateral agreement between the parties and is either a part of the ISDA Master Agreement or a collateral agreement attached to the Master Agreement (ISDA Credit Support Annex). Currently, efforts are underway to standardize CSAs under ISDA (SCSA: Standard Credit Support Annex) in consideration of OIS compliance and other factors.
