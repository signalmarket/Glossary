The world crude oil trade is divided into three markets, Asia (Middle East crude oil), Europe (North Sea blend crude oil), and North America (WTI crude oil), depending on where the crude oil is consumed. The world crude oil market is determined by cross-referencing these prices. WTI Crude Oil is the generic name for crude oil produced in the oil fields off the coast of Texas in the U.S. WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate. WTI crude oil is also called "light sweet crude oil" because of its low sulfur content (0.2%) and high quality. It has a wide range of uses, as it can be used for heating fuel, jet fuel, etc. It is one of the "futures contracts" for crude oil prices, but is also considered a synonym for overall crude oil prices and is positioned as one of the important economic indicators for the global economy.
