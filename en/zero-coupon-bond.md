Zero coupon bonds are bonds that are issued at a lower price (discounted) than their par value in exchange for no coupon (interest) payment. Since the bond is redeemed at 100% of its face value, the difference between the purchase price and face value is the difference between the purchase price and face value, which is equivalent to the profit.
