Barrier options are options whose rights are triggered or extinguished depending on whether or not the underlying asset price reaches (hits) a certain price (barrier). There are two types of options: "knock-in options," in which the option right is triggered when the underlying asset price hits the barrier, and "knock-out options," in which the option right is extinguished when the underlying asset price hits the barrier. In addition, there are two types of barriers in barrier options: "Single Barrier" and "Double Barrier. The former Single Barrier is classified into two barriers, one above and one below, while the latter Double Barrier has barriers both above and below across the underlying asset price, and some of them have different combinations of knockout and knock-in depending on the upper and lower barriers. The price calculation formula for this option differs depending on the combination of the upper and lower barriers and knock-in/knock-out, respectively.
