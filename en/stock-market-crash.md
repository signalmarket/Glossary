A major drop in the price of almost all listed stocks. Also called a "gala," this is the largest expression for a drop. In the Japanese stock market, price limits are set so that individual stocks do not fluctuate above a certain level all at once. The most famous example of a major stock market crash was Black Monday in New York on Monday, October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by $508, leading to a worldwide stock market crash, including Japan.
