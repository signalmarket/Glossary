Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM, CAPM, CAPM) is a model that describes the cross-sectional structure of the expected rate of return on financial assets, independently published in the 1960s by William Sharpe [1], John Under the CAPM, the co-variation of expected rates of return on financial assets [Note 1] is explained by the variation of the expected rate of return on a market portfolio (a market capitalization-weighted stock index). Although many asset pricing models have emerged to replace the CAPM as described below, it is one of the most fundamental asset pricing models in financial economics, and the concepts formulated by the CAPM are widely used not only in academic research but also in financial practice and personal investment methods. In particular, William Sharpe was awarded the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions to asset pricing theory research, including the derivation of the CAPM.
