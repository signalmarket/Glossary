The ratio of completed hedges to the total foreign exchange to be hedged. If the total amount of foreign exchange risk is set at 100, and the hedge is completed with 30 foreign exchange contracts and 20 currency options, the hedge ratio would be 50%, and the remaining 50% would be open and unhedged. The hedge ratio will rise or fall depending on the company's approach to hedging, internal rates, market conditions, and other factors.
