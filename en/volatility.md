Volatility is a general term for the degree of price fluctuation. In modern portfolio theory, this volatility is generally quantified as a standard deviation, which is taken as the degree of risk of the instrument. Therefore, a product with high volatility is usually considered to be risky, while a product with low volatility is considered to be low risk.
