In financial theory, a derivative is an asset or contract derived from a more basic asset or commodity [1]. They are also referred to as financial derivative products. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is determined relative to the variable value (market value or index) of the underlying financial instrument (underlying asset) [2]. Derivative transactions are essentially a type of contract entered into by firms that deal in bonds, securities (stocks, bills of lading, real estate-backed securities, etc.), real commodities, and various rights in order to hedge against future price fluctuations of the real commodities. It is a type of insurance (risk hedging) contract whereby a certain percentage of the underlying asset is deposited as margin to transfer a certain range of price fluctuation risk to other firms or market participants other than the firm. Bonds and commodities traded in the market include "standard products" and "indices.
